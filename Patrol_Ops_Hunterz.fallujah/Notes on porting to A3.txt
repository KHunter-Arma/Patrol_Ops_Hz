These are personal notes of the developer of this mission, K.Hunter. As part of the Arma Public License (https://www.bistudio.com/community/licenses) you are not allowed to redistribute a modified version of this mission without permission from the developer. This includes the port of this mission to Arma 3.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////



Main systems that will affect porting:

- Units/Weapons/Vehicles/Objects classnames
- Deprecated scripting commands (e.g. setVehicleInit and processInitCommands) or BIS functions
- Mission modules (remove A2 modules, add A3 modules that might also deprecate other systems)
- Save/Load system should work (TBC)
- New gear system and weapon attachments in A3 will require full re-write of Weapons Store code.

Core components of the mission that should be tested:

- UPS and ambient patrols
- Taskmaster including task scrips.
- Air radar script
- AI behaviour scripts (excluding 3rd party mods) such as garrison and flare scripts.
- Hunter'z scripts (artillery, tank fire HE, Grenade launchers, CAS, reinforcements, etc.)
- Realism settings (shift+click removal, mods that remove group icons and text chat, etc.)
- AI mods
- Weather system. How does it work in A3?
- Reserved slots/roles should still work if classnames are updated.
- New civilian interaction system may be needed. Better scripts/mods are available in A3.
- Different vehicles/weapons means tweaks on weapons systems have to be re-done


Lower priority systems

- Effects/actions/animations
- Nuke script?
- Better logistics script might be available for A3
- Change all references to ACE/CMS/CBA or other A2 exclusive mods to A3 counterparts.
- Base defences (might not need such complex scripts if map is not Fallujah or base is moved away from AO)
- View distance selection?
- Replace Flexi-menu functions

Systems that may be deprecated/replaced by ACE3/ACRE2 or other A3 content:

- Realistic death code (POps black screen, ACRE volume set to 0 at death, etc.)
- CMS and anything else related to medical systems and getting shot.
- LEA Hz.
- Mirrors Mod
- SMK animations
